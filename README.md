üöÄ Project Overview

This project automates the deployment of a containerized Strapi application to AWS using modern DevOps practices. It leverages Docker for containerization, Terraform for Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation, ensuring faster and more reliable deployments.

The infrastructure is designed for high availability, scalability, and zero-downtime updates using AWS ECS Fargate and Blue/Green deployment strategies.

‚ú® Key Features

Automated deployment of a containerized Strapi application to AWS EC2 & ECS Fargate using Docker and Terraform

CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions for automated builds, testing, and zero-downtime Blue/Green deployments

Comprehensive monitoring and logging via AWS CloudWatch for real-time application health and performance tracking

Scalable and fault-tolerant architecture leveraging AWS ECS, ECR, ALB, and CodeDeploy

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform for repeatable and version-controlled environment provisioning

Secure deployment workflows with secrets management in GitHub Actions

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
